# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install globally for system-wide access
npm install -g .

# Now you can run from anywhere
ai-companion

### Method 2: Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-companion

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application (current directory)
npm start

# Start with specific directory
npm start /path/to/project

# For development with hot reload
npm run dev
```

### Method 3: Direct Execution
```bash
# After installing dependencies
chmod +x main.js

# Run directly with electron (if globally installed)
./main.js /path/to/project
```

## Usage

### Global Installation Usage (Recommended)
```bash
# Start in current directory
ai-companion

# Start in specific directory
ai-companion /path/to/project
ai-companion ~/Documents/code
ai-companion .

# Start with permission bypass for restricted files
ai-companion /path/to/project --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Start with specific flags
ai-companion ~/project --no-sandbox --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### Local Development Usage
```bash
# Start in current directory
npm start

# Start in specific directory
npm start /path/to/project

# Start with sandbox disabled (if needed)
npm start /path/to/project -- --no-sandbox

# Start with permission bypass for restricted files
npm start /path/to/project -- --dangerously-skip-permissions --no-sandbox

# Development mode with hot reload
npm run dev
```

### Command Line Arguments
- **Directory Path**: First argument specifies the working directory
  - `ai-companion /home/user/project`
  - `ai-companion ~/Documents/code`
  - `ai-companion .` (current directory)
- **--dangerously-skip-permissions**: Bypass file permission errors
- **--no-sandbox**: Disable Electron sandbox (may be needed on some systems)

### Features Guide
