 Here are the key features missing compared to VS Code's file explorer:

  Git Integration:
  - Git status indicators (M, A, D, U, etc.)
  - File color coding (green for new, yellow for modified, red for deleted)
  - Git ignored files handling
  - Branch information display

  Advanced File Operations:
  - Right-click context menu (rename, delete, new file/folder)
  - Drag & drop support
  - Cut/copy/paste operations
  - File search/filtering

  Enhanced UI:
  - Breadcrumb navigation
  - Root folder selector
  - File type icons (instead of basic emojis)
  - Folder collapse/expand animations
  - Keyboard navigation

  Performance & UX:
  - Virtual scrolling for large directories
  - Lazy loading of deep folder structures
  - File watchers for real-time updates
  - Recent files/folders

  Additional Features:
  - Multi-root workspace support
  - Symlink handling
  - File permissions display
  - Sort options (name, date, size, type)
